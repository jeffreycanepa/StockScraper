These are a couple of Python3 scripts that I am working on to practice coding in Python.
    stockData-scraper.py: This script uses requests, BeautifulSoup and Scraperapi.com to extract
        stock data from https://www.investing.com.
        Output is to a csv file.

    yFinanceStockData.py: This script uses the yfinance extension to get stock data.
        Output is to a csv file.
